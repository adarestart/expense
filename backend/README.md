# Getting Started with Create React App

## Running Backend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `python manage.py makemigrations`
### `python manage.py migrate`
### `python manage.py runserver`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000/api/expenses/](http://localhost:8000/api/expenses/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Accessing Local Database

### `mysql -u root -p`

Acces the database directly from terminal.\

### `CREATE DATABASE p5;`

Created a new database for holding the data.\

### `USE p5;`

Select the designated database.\

### `SHOW TABLES;`
Display all tables in the database.\


**Note: Since it runs on localhost, so you may need to manually add data from backend [http://localhost:8000] **
